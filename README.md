# OrderJe

OrderJe is a platform that streamlines the ordering process for students and vendors. Students can place orders through the app, which will then be queued and awaiting fulfillment by the vendor. Vendors are able to easily manage and track their orders, with a simple tap of the "Order Complete" button to notify their customer once the order is ready. This app helps to improve efficiency, accuracy, and communication between vendors and students.
